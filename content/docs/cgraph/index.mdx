## Coming Soon

CGraph is a hybrid workflow combining code and visual graphs.

<Callout type="info">
This feature is currently in design. Documentation will be updated as development progresses.
</Callout>

## Planned Features

### Graph Loading

```csharp
// Load graph asset
NativeMethods.cunning_load_graph_asset("Assets/MyProcedural.cgraph");

// Cook entire graph
NativeMethods.cunning_cook_async();

// Get output
ulong geo = NativeMethods.cunning_get_output_geo();
```

### Partial Evaluation

Cook specific nodes instead of entire graph:

```csharp
// Cook up to specific node
NativeMethods.cunning_cook_to_node(nodeId);
```

### Runtime Data Injection

Inject data into graph at runtime:

```csharp
// Set parameter before cook
NativeMethods.cunning_set_param("scatter_count", 1000);
NativeMethods.cunning_set_input_geo(0, playerPosition);
```

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Complex procedural logic | Author visually, execute efficiently |
| Runtime data integration | Inject game state into graph |
| Partial evaluation | Cook only what you need |
| Rapid iteration | Modify graph, see results instantly |

## Roadmap

- [ ] Graph serialization format
- [ ] Node subset cooking
- [ ] External input binding
- [ ] Graph hot-reload
- [ ] Debugging tools
